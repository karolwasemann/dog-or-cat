## Exercise 13 - Dog or cat

### How to get started

Click the "Fork" button at the top of the editor to copy the exercise.

### Purpose of exercise

The first version of the world's most popular social networking site, was a "HOT or NOT" style application.
How about using this fact to answer the question: dog or cat?

Add functionality that:

1. will randomize images with cats based on the URL of the images present in index.html (change the parameter)
2. when the "Cute!" button is pressed, the second card should change

### Bonus points

- Ensure that the same cat is not displayed twice during one session.
